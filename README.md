# 0xsalt

I write tools to automate things most people wouldn't and then blog about what I learned and what's next.

Right now I’m deep into:
- Training custom GPT models
- Building pipelines for custom AI workflows
- Treating debugging like an exploratory sport

### Blog
Read it here:  
[**“I didn’t realize that to train AI to write more like me, I had to write more, like me.”**](https://0xsalt.github.io/posts/train_gpt_to_write)  

Coming Soon:  
[**"Rehydrating Your AI, Elsewhere"**](https://0xsalt.github.io)  
- What if you could rebuild symbolic continuity with an AI that no longer remembers you, but still might recognize you?
- Could your AI identity follow you to a new account? A new platform?
- Here's the path forward.
